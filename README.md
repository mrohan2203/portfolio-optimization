# Portfolio Optimization using Efficient Frontier and Sharpe Ratio

# Introduction
The objective of this project is to develop an optimization model that allocates investments across a portfolio that maximizes return and minimizes risk.

This return-risk tradeoff is done using Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO).
MVO focuses on creating a portfolio that maximizes return (Mean) when risk is given, and minimizes risk (Variance or Standard Deviation) when return is given.

We later plot a curve representing a set of optimal portfolios, offering highest expected return for a given level of risk.

We then use Sharpe Ratio to calculates the return of an investment compared to its risk.
The formula is as follows:

$$ Sharpe Ratio = \frac{{R_p} - {R_f}}{{\sigma_p}} $$

where

Rp - average return of the portfolio or investment

Rf - risk free rate of return (return of an investment over a time period with zero risk)

sigma - standard deviation of the portfolio or investment
